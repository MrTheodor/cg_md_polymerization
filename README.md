Polymerization in Molecular Dynamics
====================================

Copyright Â© 2015 Pierre de Buyl

cg\_md\_polymerization is a repository containing reproducible
computations for Molecular Dynamics simulations of coarse-grained
particles that undergo a polymerization process. Chain growth and step
growth are demonstrated.

Requirements and usage
----------------------

- [lammps](http://lammps.sandia.gov)
- [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/),
  [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/)

Apart from lammps that requires a separate installation, the other packages can
be installed under Debian with

    apt-get install make bash libhdf5-dev hdf5-tools python python-numpy python-matplotlib python-h5py

The custom dump style for [H5MD](http://nongnu.org/h5md/) is available at
<https://github.com/pdebuyl/lammps> (in the branch `start_dump_h5md` and is
needed to take advantage of the provided analysis tools.

To reproduce the test computation, invoke the make command.

    make step_growth

This runs a simulation of step growth where each particle can link to a maximum
of 8 other particles.

If a lammps executable named `lmp_mpi` is not found in your PATH environment
variable, you may specify it on the command-line

    make step_growth LMP=/path/to/lammps

Specific parameters to the Lennard-Jones system can be appended to the
command-line as `PROB` (probability of making a bond for each candidate pair).
Seeds for the initial velocities and for the fix `bond/create` are generated
from the `/dev/urandom` device of your computer.
