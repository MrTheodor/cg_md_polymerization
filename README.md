Polymerization in Molecular Dynamics for LAMMPS and ESPResSo++
==============================================================

Copyright Â© 2014-2015 Pierre de Buyl

cg\_md\_polymerization is a repository containing reproducible
computations for Molecular Dynamics simulations of coarse-grained
particles that undergo a polymerization process. Chain growth and step
growth are demonstrated.

Requirements and usage
----------------------

- [lammps](http://lammps.sandia.gov) The additional fix `bond/create/random` is
  necessary. It is found at
  <https://github.com/pdebuyl/lammps/tree/fbc_random/src/MC>.
- [ESPResSo++](http://www.espresso-pp.de/) version 1.9.
- [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/),
  [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/)

To reproduce the computations, invoke the make command.

    source /path/to/espressopp/ESPRC
    make chain_lammps LMP="/path/to/lmp"
    make chain_espp
    make epoxy_lammps LMP="/path/to/lmp"
    make epoxy_espp

The seeds that are needed in the simulations, for the random number generators,
are generated from the `/dev/urandom` device of your computer.
